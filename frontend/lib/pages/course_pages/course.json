        "description": "About This Class\nWhat You Need\nThe class is designed for anyone with little to no knowledge of coding. No prerequisite knowledge is required. Unlike other courses, you won't need to install anything on your computer either: All you need is a desktop, internet, and an hour of time.\nTo avoid installation, we use a website called pytwiddle.com -- it's free, doesn't require an account to use, and allows you to share code easily (by clicking on the \"Share\" button).\nWhat You\u2019ll Learn\nYou\u2019ll learn the fundamentals of code using Python. However, unlike most coding courses, this class doesn\u2019t give you an exhaustive list of minutiae; instead, you learn just enough to start using code. The goal is for you to finish the class with (a) a set of nifty tools, (b) the ability to write more nifty tools, and (c) the recognition of code\u2019s value in automating day-to-day functions. You\u2019ll cover the following concepts throughout the course:",
