        "description": "About This Class\nWhat You Need\nThe class is designed for anyone with little to no knowledge of coding. No prerequisite knowledge is required. Unlike other courses, you won't need to install anything on your computer either: All you need is a desktop, internet, and an hour of time.\nTo avoid installation, we use a website called pytwiddle.com -- it's free, doesn't require an account to use, and allows you to share code easily (by clicking on the \"Share\" button).\nWhat You\u2019ll Learn\nYou\u2019ll learn the fundamentals of code using Python. However, unlike most coding courses, this class doesn\u2019t give you an exhaustive list of minutiae; instead, you learn just enough to start using code. The goal is for you to finish the class with (a) a set of nifty tools, (b) the ability to write more nifty tools, and (c) the recognition of code\u2019s value in automating day-to-day functions. You\u2019ll cover the following concepts throughout the course:",

I want to explore the idea of productivity in more depth - break down the concept into principles and theories as well as laws and powers to provide the foundation to enable us all to understand productivity on a more fundamental level so that we can all work towards living happier, more productive lives.\nMy FREE Skillshare Bonus Resources\nAs I mentioned in the course, I\u2019ve now made a bunch of free resources for all of my Skillshare classes, exclusively for my Skillshare students. They\u2019re packed with additional course-related content for every class, and will help you refresh what you\u2019ve learnt, as well as explore some of the other classes you haven\u2019t taken yet.

        "description": "About This Class\nHolistic interior design is for anyone who is interested to take simple action within their personal space.  By transforming the space around, you can transform your space within.\nThis class is an introduction to the process of holistic interior design and how its principles & technical skills can be applied to your personal space.\n\nHolistic interior design can support wellbeing as it serves the many aspects of our human experience.  It is a practice of space design that strives for wholeness.  The approach considers our emotional connection to space.  We focus not only on how a space looks but also how it feels. \n\nDuring the course we will present our five principles of holistic design, seven technical skills, three demonstrations, and one case study.  We share so much of the knowledge we hold from working over the past nine years as professional designers in New York City. ",
