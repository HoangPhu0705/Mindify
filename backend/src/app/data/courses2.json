It started with daily sketches of little events throughout my day, but eventually, the habit ballooned into a folder with over 300 short stories about my life. \nWriting is an art that's hard to define and practice, and I think it's very important to establish a daily routine of honing this craft. In this class, I will share some of the lessons I've learned from keeping my writer's diary every day for a whole year alongside some tips for starting your own daily practice. \nIn this class you'll discover: \nWhat you should write about in your diary \nWhy your life is someone else's fiction ",

        "description": "About This Class\nIn a world that feels incredibly fast moving and ephemeral, it can feel easy to get swept away with the distractions and temptations offered to us at every turn.\nI designed and created this class to share with you my techniques for cutting through those distractions and bringing a lot of meaning and depth to everything that you do in life, big or small.\nTo do this, we're going to explore a concept that I call Intentional Documentation, which I consider to be a powerful alternative to auto piloting your way through life. In this class, we cover the principles of effective documentation, the right mindset to approach documenting your experiences, and a variety of analog and digital options.\nI'll teach you 4 methods of Intentional Documentation:\n\n1. Vlogging\n2. Journaling\n3. Photography\n4. Reporting your own life\nThere is something beautiful about capturing pieces of your life in a thoughtful way, and having these moments to look back on. Their value is immeasurable. They can create a sort of loose outline of your past. They will become portals to see where you\u2019ve come from and what you\u2019ve been through. This class is all about the cultivation of those moments.\nThis class is for anyone interested in a change of pace from the fast-moving, information saturated world that we live in.",

It isn\u2019t about journaling just because you\u2019ve seen that get popular in the world of self help over the last few years. That doesn\u2019t work.\nTo find a method that works for you, I encourage a mindset of experimentation. Feel free to test out any or all 4 of the methods that I cover.\nDepending on what resonates, you can begin to think about ways to incorporate these new methods into your life over the long term. Start with one of the methods outlined in this class to document something meaningful that happened in your day or week. From there, think about creating a clear plan for yourself on how you can make this a regular practice in your life over the long term.",

For a lot of us, the personal statement is often the most important thing that we'll ever write. It's the thing that'll determine the next 4-6 years of our lives. So it's easy to see the importance of making sure it's the best it can be. My name's Shaene and I'm a doctor, Cambridge University Graduate and Oxford University Supervisor - and I'll be taking you from the beginning to the end of your personal statement journey. \nPart One - Building Blocks\nIn the first few lessons, we're first going to be looking at the expertly designed 8 pillar framework based on personal statements of students who were accepted into Oxbridge and other top ranking universities. These 8 pillars will form the basis of your thought process and help you decide what to include in the personal statement. Think of these pillars as the building blocks.\nWe're going to spend some time learning how best to reflect on experiences in ways that show the reader that you are someone who is capable of extracting lessons and developing for the better as a result of it.",

It is a basic class just about the brushlettering itself, not about procreate and also not about what fun you can all do with it. That will be in a later class. You can even follow the class with a brushpen and actual paper. Perhaps not as much fun as I would it to be, but you have to learn to ride the bike first before you can make beautyful trips. Sad but true...\nI still hope you will enjoy the class and the skills I will teach you. \nSo get the brushset en the canvas below and let's get started. Please make sure to post you project as in one word or perhaps a quote or the bonus project in the projectsection of this class afterwards and please do leave a review of the class. Thank you \nHave fun!",

We don't want you to share your entire screenplay on here - it's too valuable! So there are three class projects to share and get feedback on which will help you develop your idea:.\n1. Logline. Write your logline and share it. Let's see if it communicates the idea and engages us.\n2. Three Act Structure. Complete your three act structure (using the handy guide provided). Let's see if your story is ready to go to the script phase.\n3 Showcase Scene. Complete your first draft and share one scene that really shows off your skills. We'll see if you've taken in the screenwriter's toolkit and put into practice your structure, before seeing it through with a brilliantly written scene, with dynamic action and dialogue.",
