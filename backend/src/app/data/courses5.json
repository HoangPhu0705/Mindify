        "projectDescription": "Hands-on Class Project\nHi everyone,\nYou can find the downloads and resources here: https://lizkohlerbrown.com/design-a-pattern-collection-on-your-ipad-class-downloads-and-resources/ (the password is shown in Video 3)\nThe project for this class is a pattern collection of any size using any of the processes we covered in the class.  If you participate in the the pattern challenge on Instagram remember to tag me @lizkohlerbrown and use the hashtag #ipadpatternchallenge so I don't miss your patterns.  I can't wait to see your collections!\nHere are the prompts for the challenge:\nNote: Skillshare projects have 2 parts:\n1) the cover image (which gets cropped to 6 inches wide x 4 inches tall)\nand\n2) the projects (which can have any dimensions, image size under 2MB)  Remember that it's best not to share your repeat block online, so use the process in the class to make a repeated image for sharing!\nHappy creating!",
