Gesture drawing is one of the most important, but least understood parts of the figure drawing process, but Instructor Brent Eviston will guide you through the figure drawing process with the same award-winning instruction and hands on projects that have made his other drawing courses bestsellers.\nThis course brings the figure drawing studio to you by providing master instruction and timed practice poses for you to draw from.  Once enrolled you\u2019ll learn from numerous anatomical diagrams, detailed drawing demonstrations and hundreds of photographs of a fully nude model.\nThis course contains 12 lessons, each filled with essential figure drawing techniques. Each lesson contains at least one practice reel with times poses specifically chosen so you can get the most out of the lesson they accompany.\nBy the end of this course you\u2019ll be able to do gesture drawings that stand alone as works of art as well as lay the foundation for more detailed figure drawings",

Designed for aspiring painters, graphic designers, illustrators and artists of all types, The Art & Science of Drawing series will teach you the foundation of art and design of all kinds: drawing.\nIn this course you\u2019ll learn to draw in three dimensions, giving your drawings a dramatic sense of volumes and deep space.\nFORM & SPACE is the third course in The Art & Science of Drawing series designed to take students from the absolute basics to advanced drawing techniques like perspective drawing and shading. Here\u2019s how it works: \nYou\u2019ll start by learning how to draw the sphere, the cylinder and the cube, the foundational shapes that all other forms are constructed from.  Next you\u2019ll learn to combine and manipulate these basic volumes to draw any form observable or imaginable.  You'll even get an introduction to linear perspective! Never again will your drawings appear flat and lifeless on the page.",

In this beginner-friendly class, you will learn how to use landscape painting as a tool to help you slow down and document your favorite places. In this class, we'll learn to view painting not as a science, but as an adventure... because nature is perfectly imperfect!\nPainting landscapes is a meditative activity. As you sit in front of a landscape, you are given the time and space to fully absorb all the sights, sounds, and feelings of being there. This allows you to better be present in the experience than if you were to quickly snap a photo with your phone and move on. \nNature illustrator Rosalie Haizlett has traveled all over the world with her sketchbook, documenting the unique creatures and landscapes that she encounters. In this class, Rosalie will first show you some techniques for creating a quick landscape watercolor from a photo. Then, she\u2019ll invite you to come along with her as she adventures out to find a new landscape to paint from life\u2026 and she\u2019ll give you guidance for creating your own landscape painting from life as well!
