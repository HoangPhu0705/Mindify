You've made it to the end of the class!\n\nNow it's time to put all these newfound skills to use!\n\nFor our class project, I'd like you to utilize the \"Class Project_Set Up.blend\" file found in the project resources and assemble your very own cozy campsite!\n\nThis file has everything you need to complete the class project. In side you'll find a single copy of each model shown in the starter file, as well as 2 distinct lighting set ups - Nighttime and Daytime!\n\nSimply use the transformation tools (move, rotate and scale) to place your objects in the scene like a 3d diorama. Don't forget to use duplication (Shift+D) to make copies of objects like trees and mushrooms!\n\nI walk you through an entire example of how to start your class project in , so make sure you watch that video if you're not sure how to begin.\n\nJust remember to have fun and don't stress out about the details! This project is a way to share your hard work and creativity with the other students and myself to show how far you've come since starting the class! \n\n\n\nIf you're unsure how to post your project to the gallery, let me give you a quick explanation:\n\n1. Render and save your image as a .JPG or .PNG file in Blender\n2. Click the button located in the tab below the video player.",

I\u2019ll take you through my creative process when making an illustrated character for animation and show you how I take this into After Effects to animate. Then I\u2019ll show you exactly how to export and upload your GIF to Skillshare. All you need to do is follow along!\nNot only this but completing this assignment will give you a moving illustration to share on your social media or online portfolio too! \nYour projects should be a GIF (See 'Export' lesson) and 1080 px by 1080px in size.",
